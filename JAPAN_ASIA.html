      First and foremost, Tokyo has some of the best restaurants in the world, from casual rustic walk-ins to globally acclaimed omakase spots. 
      Chefs dedicate their lives to mastering techniques with their shokunin spirit—the virtue of seeking perfection in their craft. 
      Intricately prepared dishes are served with impeccable service, stemming from the tradition of omotenashi—a deep-rooted psyche of taking care of guests.

    <p>
      With flowers emerging after a cold winter, spring represents “new beginnings” in Japan (including the school year, which starts in April). 
      The first sakura, or cherry blossom, appears in the southern islands, and the phenomenon moves its way northwards. 
      There are over 600 types of sakura trees across the country with varying shades of pink. Petals gradually unfold outwards until reaching their peak mankai (full bloom) for a mere few days.
