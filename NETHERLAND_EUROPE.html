        <p><b><span style="font-size:50px;">Tulip Season</span></b><br><br>
        The tulip bulbs are one of the most well-known emblems of the Netherlands. Its seemingly infinite tulip fields enchant every traveler 
        <br>with their stunning colors that occupy the flat meadows of some locations of the Netherlands. Noordoostpolder in Flevoland and 
        <br>The Hague, Alkmaar, and Leiden are popular tulip farms to visit. Every National Tulip Day, Amsterdam presents a tulip exhibit in Dam Square, where visitors can pick their own.</p><br>

        // second image set
        $images2 = ["netherlandA.jpg","netherlandB.jpg","netherlandC.jpg"];
        foreach($images2 as $img){
            echo "<img src='$img' width='400' height='300' style='margin:5px;'>";
        }
        ?>

        <p><b><span style="font-size:50px;">Quaint Towns And Charming Neighborhoods</span></b><br><br>
        There is no doubt that Amsterdam is on every traveler's bucket list, but what many folks don't know is that the Netherlands is home to several beautiful villages 
        <br>and charming neighborhoods in various cities. Gierthoorn, a lovely town in the northeastern portion of Overijssel, is one of these. 
        <br>Gierthoorn is known for its greenery and charming villages that can only be reached by boat or on foot through the bridges, making it a car-free town. 
        <br>Furthermore, Broek in Waterland is also a must-see town in the Netherlands.</p><br>

        }
        ?>

        <p><b><span style="font-size:50px;">Fascinating Landscape</span></b><br><br>
        The Netherlands is a relatively flat country with a diverse landscape. Aside from the distinctive windmills and endless fields of brilliant 
        <br>flowers that fascinate every tourist, the Netherlands also has mountain ranges and lakes surrounded by forested mountainsides. Cauberg, 
        <br>Eyserbosweg, Keutenberg, Mount Saint Peter, Vaalserberg, and Vrouwenheide are some of the mountains and hills in the 
        <br>Netherlands. Tourists can access these peaks by hiking, strolling, or mountain biking. In addition, there are unique species of birds and flowers in these highlands.
